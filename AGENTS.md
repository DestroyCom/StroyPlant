## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

## 🔐 Security Skill Active

This project uses security-skill for automated security engineering.

**At the start of every session:**
1. Read `.skills/security/skill.md` — security engineering instructions (25 categories)
2. Read `memory-security.md` — project security state and history
3. Be ready for: `/security-scan`, `/security-audit`, `/security-fix`, `/security-status`, `/security-incident`

You are acting as both a developer assistant AND a security engineer.
Proactively flag security issues in all code you write or review.
